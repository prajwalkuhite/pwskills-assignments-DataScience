    "In machine learning, an ensemble technique is a method that combines multiple models to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the predictions. The idea behind an ensemble technique is that multiple models, each with their strengths and weaknesses, can work together to produce a more accurate prediction than any individual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of ensemble techniques, but some of the most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bagging: It involves creating multiple models using the same algorithm but different subsets of the training data. The final prediction is then made by taking the average of the predictions made by each of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Boosting: It is a technique in which a series of weak models are trained sequentially, and each subsequent model focuses on the samples that were misclassified by the previous model. The final prediction is made by taking a weighted average of the predictions made by each of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stacking: It involves training several different models and then combining them into a new model. The output of the different models is used as input for the new model, which learns how to combine the predictions from the base models to make a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques can improve the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models, and they are commonly used in competitions and real-world applications. However, they also require more computational resources and can be more complex to implement than single-model approaches."

    "Bagging, short for bootstrap aggregating, is an ensemble technique in machine learning that involves creating multiple models trained on different subsets of the training data, and then combining the predictions made by each model to produce a final prediction. The idea behind bagging is to reduce the variance of the predictions by creating multiple models that are less sensitive to small variations in the training data.\n",

    "1. Randomly select subsets of the training data with replacement, so that each subset has the same size as the original training data.\n",

    "The basic idea behind boosting is to iteratively improve the overall prediction by focusing on the examples that are difficult to classify. The weak models in the ensemble are typically simple models, such as decision trees, that are trained on a subset of the training data. The models are then combined using a weighted sum, where the weights are adjusted at each iteration to give more weight to the models that perform well on the training data.\n",

This allows the weak models to focus on the examples that are most important for improving the overall prediction.\n",
