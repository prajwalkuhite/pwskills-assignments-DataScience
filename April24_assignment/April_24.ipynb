    "A projection refers to the transformation of data points from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space. The goal is to capture the essential structure and patterns of the data in a more compact representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction. It uses projections as a key step in its algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Centering the Data`: The first step in PCA is to center the data by subtracting the mean of each feature from the corresponding data points. This ensures that the data is centered around the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Computing the Covariance Matrix`: PCA computes the covariance matrix of the centered data. The covariance matrix provides information about the relationships between different features and their variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Calculating Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues`: The next step is to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, which are the directions of maximum variance in the data. The eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Selecting Principal Components`: PCA sorts the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order. The eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues capture the most significant variance in the data. These are the principal components that will be retained for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Projection`: Finally, PCA performs the projection of the original data onto the selected principal components. Each data point is transformed into a new set of coordinates, representing its projection onto the subspace spanned by the principal components. The resulting projected data has a reduced dimensionality, with the number of dimensions equal to the number of selected principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection step in PCA effectively maps the data points onto a lower-dimensional space defined by the selected principal components. By retaining the principal components with the highest eigenvalues, which correspond to the most significant sources of variance in the data, PCA captures the essential structure of the original data while discarding less important information."
