    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines both L1 and L2 regularization methods to improve model performance and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function that equals the absolute value of the coefficients. This encourages the model to reduce the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regression, adds a penalty term to the loss function that equals the squared value of the coefficients. This shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing their impact on the model's output and improving its ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net regression combines both L1 and L2 regularization by adding a weighted sum of the two penalty terms to the loss function. This allows the model to benefit from the strengths of both regularization methods and find a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage."

    "## Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Selection: Elastic Net Regression can perform feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero, resulting in a more interpretable and efficient model.\n",
    "2. Handles multicollinearity: Elastic Net Regression can handle multicollinearity, which occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, by shrinking the coefficients of highly correlated variables.\n",
    "3. Works well with high-dimensional data: Elastic Net Regression is particularly useful when working with high-dimensional data where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.\n",
    "4. Flexibility: Elastic Net Regression offers a balance between the L1 and L2 regularization methods, which makes it more flexible than the individual regularization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computational Intensity: Elastic Net Regression can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets, due to the cross-validation and grid search process required to select the optimal regularization parameters.\n",
    "2. May require tuning of hyperparameters: Elastic Net Regression requires tuning of hyperparameters such as the regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, which may be difficult to do in practice.\n",
    "3. Assumes linear relationships: Like other linear regression models, Elastic Net Regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable, which may not always be the case.\n",
    "4. Limited to linear models: Elastic Net Regression is limited to linear models and may not be suitable for more complex non-linear relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable."
