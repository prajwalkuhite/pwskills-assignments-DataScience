    "Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the independent variables, multiplied by a tuning parameter (lambda). The purpose of the penalty term is to shrink the coefficients towards zero, which can effectively perform feature selection by setting some of the coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Ridge regression, and Elastic Net regression in the way it performs feature selection. OLS regression and Ridge regression do not perform feature selection, while Elastic Net regression is a combination of Ridge and Lasso regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of Lasso Regression over other regression techniques is that it can handle high-dimensional datasets with many independent variables. Lasso Regression can effectively select the most important features and set the coefficients of the less important features to zero, resulting in a simpler and more interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Lasso Regression also has some limitations. It may not work well in cases where the predictors are highly correlated, as it tends to select only one of the correlated predictors and set the others to zero. Additionally, the choice of the tuning parameter lambda can be challenging and requires careful tuning to balance between bias and variance."

    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can automatically identify and select the most relevant features in a dataset, while also reducing the impact of irrelevant or redundant features. This can lead to a simpler and more interpretable model that is less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso Regression algorithm works by adding a penalty term to the linear regression objective function, which is proportional to the absolute value of the regression coefficients. As a result, Lasso Regression tends to produce sparse solutions, meaning that some of the coefficients are exactly zero. This can be interpreted as an automatic feature selection mechanism, where the features with non-zero coefficients are considered to be the most important for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other feature selection techniques, such as stepwise regression or principal component analysis, Lasso Regression has several advantages. First, it can handle highly correlated features by selecting only one of them, whereas other methods may select all of them. Second, it does not require any assumptions about the distribution of the input variables. Finally, it can handle large datasets with many input variables without overfitting or requiring a lot of computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Lasso Regression is a powerful and flexible tool for feature selection in linear regression models, and it can be particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets with a large number of input features."

    "\n",
    "First, the sign of the coefficient indicates the direction and strength of the relationship between the corresponding input feature and the target variable. A positive coefficient means that the feature has a positive effect on the target variable, while a negative coefficient means that the feature has a negative effect. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship, with larger magnitudes indicating stronger effects.\n",

    "Second, the presence of a non-zero coefficient indicates that the corresponding input feature is important for predicting the target variable.

    "It is important to note that the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be affected by the scaling of the input features. Therefore, it is often a good idea to normalize or standardize the input features before fitting a Lasso Regression model, so that the coefficients can be compared more easily.\n",
    "\n",

    "The λ parameter controls the strength of the penalty applied to the magnitude of the coefficients in the objective function of the regression model. A higher value of λ will result in more shrinkage of the coefficients towards zero, which means that the model will have a simpler structure with fewer features. On the other hand, a lower value of λ will allow for more flexibility in the model and may result in overfitting.\n",

    "The choice of the λ parameter is critical for the performance of the Lasso Regression model. The optimal value of λ can be selected using cross-validation techniques, where the data is split into training and validation sets, and the model is trained on the training set with different values of λ. The performance of the model is evaluated on the validation set using a chosen metric, such as mean squared error or R-squared. The λ value that yields the best performance on the validation set is selected as the optimal value.\n",

    "In practice, there is often a trade-off between the number of features included in the model and its predictive power. A value of λ that is too high may exclude important features from the model, resulting in poor predictive performance.
