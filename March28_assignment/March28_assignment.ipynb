    "Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique used for dealing with multicollinearity, which occurs when predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated with each other. In Ridge Regression, a penalty term is added to the sum of squared errors, which helps to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients of highly correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Ridge Regression is called the L2 regularization, which is represented by the square of the L2 norm of the coefficients. By adding the L2 regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function, Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients of highly correlated variables towards zero, without completely eliminating them, which results in a better generalization performance of the model on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) is a simple linear regression technique that aims to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values. OLS does not include any regularization term and assumes that the predictor variables are independent of each other. As a result, OLS may not perform well when multicollinearity is present, as it can lead to unstable and overfit models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Ridge Regression is a regularized version of linear regression that helps to reduce multicollinearity and improves the performance of the model on unseen data, while OLS is a simple linear regression technique that does not account for multicollinearity and may not generalize well when it is present."

    "2. Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",

    "5. No multicollinearity: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. This assumption is particularly important for Ridge Regression, as it assumes that the independent variables are not too correlated with each other, so that the regularization term can shrink the coefficients towards zero.\n",

Each binary variable takes on a value of 1 if the observation belongs to that category, and 0 otherwise. For example, if we have a categorical variable called \"color\" with three categories: red, blue, and green, we can create three binary variables: \"is_red\", \"is_blue\", and \"is_green\". The value of \"is_red\" will be 1 if the observation is red and 0 otherwise, and so on for the other two binary variables.\n",
